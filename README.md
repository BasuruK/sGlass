**sGlass** is a platform designed for Visually Impaired Children to support them though theier lerning tasks.
As children with such dissability is it s hard task for them to learn on how to precieve the objects arround them
and identifying them. 

sGlass is designed in a perticular way where the application recognized the objects in a scenario and tracks the 
users hand all times to see what are the objects the user is touching. The appliction works on a voice command based
interaciton mechanism where users can simply ask the system to get the perticular task done.

sGlass is developped by using state of the art deep learning libreries such as Keras and Tensorflow and Computer Vision
libraries.

_This Application is developped using following libreries_

This research product is specialized to use in a place with good lighting conditions and requires the following plugins and requirements in order to successfully execute.
